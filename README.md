# [10:00-10:20] - Opening Address 
![Jenni Quint](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYx01Pa0.png)

Research can be both thrilling and daunting, especially at the early stages of your career. Our goal with this forum is to connect you with peers, mentors, and resources that will help you advance your work and broaden your horizons. Together, we will explore new perspectives, discuss cutting-edge developments, and build networks that will last long beyond this event.

## Talk Highlights
**Do not give up**
* Reach out for any advice 
* Fate, luck, sheer grit and determination
* No two career pathways are the same, and it's important to do what you enjoy so it doesn't feel like hard work all the time, and not worry that things are not necesssarily following the same path as other people.
* Experience through placements and keep self reflection and re-evaluation of path forward. 
* PhD is hard work/life balance but you will survive it as we did
* Having support network, suround yourself with great people

**Top tips**:
* Find your focus and soround yourself with supportive people
* Fail and allow yourself to fail - it does make you stronger
* Don't give up
* Be nice to people : you never know who you are gonna meet on the way up or on the way down
* Be different : do what you want to do and find a way to do it
*

## Fabian Falck
![03a-FF](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByM99EqaR.png)


### Talk Highlights
* Generative AI models
* Learning data distribution and using the generative model in different conditions
* Clustring high dimentional data: lots of different assets presented in the dataset - how to go about it where there are multiple and diverse characteristics on various facets?
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will feed into your approach onto this

Steps of EDA
* Visualising each facet in the data 
* Finding homogenous examples vs hetrogeneous facets
* No relationship or inferencial activities happening at this stage
* Hierachical 
* Looking at existing Units in data 
* Unit is an approximation of a data piece
* Units use average of 2 coefficients to approximate but there is an alternative approach to this...hierachical VAEs 
* Fusion models current state-of-the-art

## Emma Whitfield
![03b-EW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkYjnaD6A.png)

### Talk Highlights
* Diagnosis is a challenging task compounded by various factors
* Compare frequency of a set of characteristics based on their occurance during the process of diagnosis
* Why emergency presentation matters: there is a well-established corrolation between ED presence for different types of cancer
* It is important to depict similaries in ED presence for cancer vs other disease

## Haoting Zhang
![03c-HZ](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rksTn6vpC.png)

### Talk Highlights
* drug combination synergies
* AZ public dataset including more than 11000 drug combinations
* A combined therapy is more effective than single therapy
* There is no gold standard for synergy score and it is framework dependent 
* Ideal drug: maximum efficacy, minimum potency so a small dosage will provide required therapeutic target
*

### Venexia Walker
**Producing analysis-ready datasets in TRE/SDE setting**
Location: Lacks2, 7th Floor
![05d-VW](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy9Ky4O6R.png)

Stages of making an analysis ready data asset: 

* Create a spine, recommended approach would be to take all those who are registered in a primary care in England - in establishing spine make sure there is not an overlap with the study cohort i.e. for studying patients with covid-19 if the vaccination data is a mandatory element on defining the spine the population might be biased by those who are not presented in vaccine dataset due to them being unvaccinated. 
* Make an event list and decide what to do with recurrent events
* Be detailed about range of covariates, exposure and outcome variables in the study protocols 
* Careful consideration of variable names: you can encode 
* Agree on naming conventions 
* Data quality checks and quality assurance on the curated table: people with a record post date of death, born on future dates etc. 
* Sample size is less of a limit due to huge pool of national records
